Here is the working

[1] . 

This is an obfuscated code to print the Map of India. 

The Code can mainly  be Divided in 4 parts :

**(i) The Mystery String :** 

Well it is type of [Run-length Encoding][2] where each character at even position tells us how many spaces to print and odd character tells us how many '!' to print. 

Also first 31 characters of this string are omitted. 

**For Eg:** 

The 32nd character is 'T' so the it will print space 'T'-64 times or (84-64)=20 times and the next character is 'F' so this tells to print 'F'-64 times the character '!' or (70-64) = 6 times.

**(ii) Outer Loop :** 

This loop traverse through the **Mystery String** and **b** is used as index of the character and **a** stores the value of the character . 


**(iii) Inner Loop :** 

The value of **c** goes from **10 to 90** **( ascii value of 'Z')** and it is used for printing the characters and the character are printed **a-64 times**.

**(iv) putchar :** 

The putchar can be re-written as :- 


    ++c;
    if(c=='Z') //Ascii value of 'Z' is 90
    {
       c/=9; // Here c becomes 10 which is the ascii value of newline
       putchar(c);
    }
    else
    {
       if(b&1)  //Here the trick used is ascii value of ! is 33 and of ' ' is 32 so he xors 33^(b&1)
          putchar('!');
       else
          putchar(' ');
    }
